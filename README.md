## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the recipe page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (CSS variables)
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first responsive design workflow
- CSS media queries for mobile optimization
- Custom typography with Google Fonts (Outfit & Young Serif)

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of responsive design and CSS custom properties. I particularly focused on creating a clean, accessible recipe card layout that works seamlessly across all device sizes.

**Key learnings include:**

**CSS Custom Properties for consistent theming:**
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
  --secondary-color: hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
  --text-grey-brown: hsl(30, 10%, 34%);
  --rose: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
}

### Semantic HTML structure for accessibility

```html
<main>
  <article class="recipe">
    <header>
      <h1>Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>
    </header>
    <section class="prep-time">
      <!-- Preparation details -->
    </section>
  </article>
</main>
```

## Continued development

### Areas I want to continue focusing on in future projects:

- **CSS Grid** – While I used Flexbox effectively here, I want to explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts
- **Advanced animations** – Adding subtle hover effects and micro-interactions to enhance user experience
- **Accessibility improvements** – Implementing better focus management and ARIA labels for screen readers
- **Performance optimization** – Exploring image optimization techniques and lazy loading
